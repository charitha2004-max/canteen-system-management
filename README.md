Smart Student Complaint Management System
📌 Project Overview
The Smart Student Complaint Management System is a web-based application designed to digitize and streamline the process of handling student complaints in educational institutions. It provides a structured platform where students can raise complaints online, and administrators can efficiently track, manage, and resolve them.

The system improves transparency, reduces manual effort, and ensures accountability by allowing real-time status tracking and admin responses.
